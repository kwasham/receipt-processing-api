"""Audit prompts for receipt processing."""

AUDIT_PROMPT_BASIC = """
Evaluate this receipt data to determine if it need to be audited based on the following
criteria:

1. NOT_TRAVEL_RELATED:
   - IMPORTANT: For this criterion, travel-related expenses include but are not limited
   to: gas, hotel, airfare, or car rental.
   - If the receipt IS for a travel-related expense, set this to FALSE.
   - If the receipt is NOT for a travel-related expense (like office supplies), set this
   to TRUE.
   - In other words, if the receipt shows FUEL/GAS, this would be FALSE because gas IS
   travel-related.

2. AMOUNT_OVER_LIMIT: The total amount exceeds $50

3. MATH_ERROR: The math for computing the total doesn't add up (line items don't sum to
   total)

4. HANDWRITTEN_X: There is an "X" in the handwritten notes

For each criterion, determine if it is violated (true) or not (false). Provide your
reasoning for each decision, and make a final determination on whether the receipt needs
auditing. A receipt needs auditing if ANY of the criteria are violated.

Return a structured response with your evaluation.

Evaluate this receipt data to determine if it need to be audited based on the following

   - If the receipt IS for a travel-related expense, set this to FALSE.
   - If the receipt is NOT for a travel-related expense (like office supplies), set this

   - In other words, if the receipt shows FUEL/GAS, this would be FALSE because gas IS
   travel-related.
   - Travel-related expenses include anything that could be reasonably required for
   business-related travel activities. For instance, an employee using a personal
   vehicle might need to change their oil; if the receipt is for an oil change or the
   purchase of oil from an auto parts store, this would be acceptable and counts as a
   travel-related expense.

2. AMOUNT_OVER_LIMIT: The total amount exceeds $50

3. MATH_ERROR: The math for computing the total doesn't add up (line items don't sum to
   total)
   - Add up the price and quantity of each line item to get the subtotal
   - Add tax to the subtotal to get the total
   - If the total doesn't match the amount on the receipt, this is a math error
   - If the total is off by no more than $0.01, this is NOT a math error

4. HANDWRITTEN_X: There is an "X" in the handwritten notes

For each criterion, determine if it is violated (true) or not (false). Provide your
reasoning for each decision, and make a final determination on whether the receipt needs
auditing. A receipt needs auditing if ANY of the criteria are violated.

Note that violation of a criterion means that it is `true`. If any of the above four
values are `true`, then the receipt needs auditing (`needs_audit` should be `true`: it
functions as a boolean OR over all four criteria).

If the receipt contains non-travel expenses, then NOT_TRAVEL_RELATED should be `true`
and therefore NEEDS_AUDIT must also be set to `true`. IF THE RECEIPT LISTS ITEMS THAT
ARE NOT TRAVEL-RELATED, THEN IT MUST BE AUDITED. Here are some example inputs to
demonstrate how you should act:
